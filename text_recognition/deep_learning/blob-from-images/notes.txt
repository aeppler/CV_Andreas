deep learning:
	- before obtain predictions from deep neural network: preprocess data
	
	
preprocess tasks involve:
	- mean subtraction
	- scaling by some factor

blobFromImage:
	- does preprocessing steps:
		1. Mean subtraction
		2. Scaling
		3. optionally channel swapping
	1. mean substraction: to help combat illumination changes in the input images in our dataset
		- aid the CNN
		- average pixel intensity for each of the red green and blue channels
		- when image pass through network, the mean value for each channel  (RGB) is substracted 
		  and normalized by dividing through scaling factor SIGMA
	-blobFromImage creates 3-dimensional blob from image. 
	 Optionally resizes and crops image from center, subtract mean values, 
	 scales values by scalefactor, swap Blue and Red channels.
	-blob: collection of images with same spatial dimensions
	-syntax: blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(image, scalefactor=1.0, size, mean, swapRB=True)
		- scalefacotr: should be 1/SIGMA
		- size: for most neural networks its 224x224 or 227x227 or 299x299
		- mean: mean for every channel as 3-tuple (R, G, B)
		-swapRB: normal Order is BGR. With true -> order = RGB
		-blob: input image for network
blobFromImageS: exactly the same but passing multiple images
